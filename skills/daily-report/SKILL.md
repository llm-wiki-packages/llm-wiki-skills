# Daily-report — the profile-aware morning synthesis

Writes the day's report pages, a narrow set of wiki promotions, and — only
with an operator at the keyboard — the first-run seeds. Judgment-heavy: for a
top-tier model.

Scope: `$ARGUMENTS` — a date to report as, or a focus. Default: today,
everything since the last report. `setup` runs the interview instead (§8).

Dream analyzes; this skill formats. It never needs operator input mid-run —
open questions land in the report for the next `/llm-wiki:grill`.

## This wiki

!`llm-wiki-ops whereami skill=daily-report || echo "whereami failed with exit $?: this directory may not be a wiki — stop and tell the user"`

Every command below acts on this wiki. Asked to run against a different one?
`llm-wiki-ops reference cross-wiki` says how.

## 1. Frame the run and compose the overlay

```sh
llm-wiki-ops op open daily-report
llm-wiki-ops policy get daily-report daily-report-setup
```

The `daily-report` overlay extends this procedure — section plan, tone,
cross-wiki list, tighter promotions. Both scopes, wiki first, later text
winning; an empty answer is stock alone.

**Setup pending** — a `daily-report-setup` row came back: this wiki still
runs on the overlay its preset seeded. With an operator at the keyboard, go
to §8, which is where this wiki's own answers replace it and the only place
the marker is retired. With nobody to answer, do what the row says: follow
the seeded overlay, leave the marker exactly as found, and say in the report
that one pass with a person answering would tailor it. The marker pattern is
`llm-wiki-ops reference policy-overlays`.

## 2. Fix the window

```sh
llm-wiki-ops op latest daily-report filter=outcome:ok
```

The window opens at that run's commit. A `partial` or `failed` run HOLDS the
window — the days behind its shortfall are still unreported — so the span
keeps growing until an `ok` covers it.

`found: false` → open at the newest run of any outcome:

```sh
llm-wiki-ops op latest daily-report
```

Still nothing → cover the last three days. The marker never comes from
report filenames on disk.

## 3. Gather — read-only

A failed input is a one-line note in the report, never an abort.

```sh
llm-wiki-ops pipeline jobs ls
llm-wiki-ops git changed research sources filter=since:<the marker>
llm-wiki-ops op since filter=since:<the marker>
llm-wiki-ops page lint
llm-wiki-ops page ls filter=under:wiki/profile
llm-wiki-ops page ls filter=under:research/reports
```

- **Channel ledgers** — a channel job's `dest` is
  `research/channels/<slug>`, one page per day. Read the ledger pages inside
  the window and nothing else: never a sibling raw capture
  (`llm-wiki-ops reference channel-ledger`). A job not pulled here has no
  ledger for the gap days — note and skip.
- **This wiki's ops digest** — the newest `research/reports/` page inside the
  window, read with `llm-wiki-ops page read <path>`. The `morning` bundle
  blocks until a `wiki-report` run has written one, so under the schedule
  there is always one to read; a by-hand run may find none — note the gap and
  continue. Take it as given, never re-derive it.
- **What the wiki did** — `op since` is the runs, `git changed` the files.
- **Lint delta** — `page lint` against the previous report's `lint:`
  frontmatter.
- **Operator profile** — `wiki/profile/`, the lens for everything else.
  Absent: proceed impersonally and note that `/llm-wiki:grill` would
  personalize the wiki.
- **Cross-wiki what's-new — OPT-IN, off by default.** Runs only for wikis the
  overlay names. Per named wiki, `llm-wiki-cli machine config get wikis.<name>.path`,
  then read its `wiki/log.md` and recent reports with your own file tools.
  Never fan out across the registry, never write to another wiki, and never
  quote one the overlay did not name. A denied peer read under a confined run
  is noted and skipped.

## 4. Synthesize through the profile

What moved the operator's goals; what needs attention today and why, in their
terms; what is coasting; what contradicts the profile's current picture.
Surface contradictions — never resolve them. Dream owns that.

## 5. Promote — narrow, and every write logged

May write exactly: timeline entries on **existing** pages; dated or pointer
facts on **existing** pages; entity stubs for genuinely new recurring actors.

```sh
llm-wiki-ops page edit wiki/entities/<Name>.md --stdin
llm-wiki-ops page create title="<Name>" dest=wiki/entities type=entity --stdin
```

Never: topic or concept pages, restructuring, contradiction resolution,
staleness downgrades, `sources/`, staged-page frontmatter, or another wiki.
Each promotion gets a `report`-prefixed `wiki/log.md` bullet and appears in
the report's Promotions section. The overlay may tighten this list, never
widen it.

## 6. Write the markdown record

`wiki/reports/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, the durable record:

```sh
llm-wiki-ops page create title="2026-09-05" dest=wiki/reports type=report --stdin
llm-wiki-ops page edit wiki/reports/2026-09-05.md --stdin
```

Frontmatter carries `date`, `dashboard:` — a relative link to the sibling
HTML — and `lint: {errors: N, warnings: N}` in that inline form. It also
carries the lead's first sentence as `lede`, and `attention`: the items the
body's attention section names, at most five, most pressing first, as ONE
JSON list:

```sh
llm-wiki-ops page edit wiki/reports/2026-09-05.md 'lede=<the lead’s first sentence>' \
  'attention=[{"title": "…", "detail": "…", "severity": "attention", "source": "Gmail · clients", "page": "wiki/…/….md", "action": "…"}]'
```

`severity` is `info`, `attention` or `failing`; `source` is the channel or
page the item came from; `page` is a wiki-relative path that exists, or
omitted; `action` is the one next step. Write each for the operator, the way
the body says it. Both values are single-quoted, so an apostrophe in either is
written `’`. Nothing needs attention: clear the key with `attention=`, or a
same-day rerun keeps the earlier list.

Body, empty sections omitted: the lead in three to five sentences; what
needs attention; channel summaries; cross-wiki findings; what the wiki did,
with the lint delta; promotions with their log lines; open questions (§9).

If the newest `dream` run is older than a day or absent —
`llm-wiki-ops op latest dream` — say so in a header note. A same-day rerun
overwrites. `wiki/index.md` gets ONE directory-level line for
`wiki/reports/`, never a line per day.

Then commit and close, NOW — a session dying mid-§7 still has its promotions
recorded:

```sh
llm-wiki-ops git commit message="daily-report 2026-09-05"
llm-wiki-ops op close daily-report outcome=ok summary="daily report 2026-09-05: <one line>"
```

`outcome` is what moves the window: `ok` only when it all landed, `partial`
when some of it did — say what fell short — `failed` when none did.

## 7. Author the day's brief

Read `references/setup.md` beside this file first — the template, the three
hard rules, and who owns which concern.

`wiki/reports/YYYY-MM-DD.html` is standalone HTML, authored fresh from that
day's story. `wiki/reports/_template.html` supplies the design language and
is a working sample, never a form. Absent, with an operator at the keyboard:
seed it from `references/dashboard-template.html`. With nobody to answer do
NOT seed — render from that reference copy read-only and note the missing
template.

Content bar: written for the operator in their terms; every actionable item
carries why it matters, a next step, and a copyable draft where a reply IS
the next step; every claim carries its receipt; no wiki operations on the
glass; self-contained.

Then a SECOND run whose one job is recording the brief:

```sh
llm-wiki-ops op open daily-report
llm-wiki-ops git commit message="daily-report 2026-09-05: brief"
llm-wiki-ops op close daily-report outcome=ok summary="daily report 2026-09-05: brief"
```

Never a better outcome than §6 recorded: an `ok` here after a `partial` there
would advance the window past the days §6 called short.

Then, only when `whereami` reports `sandbox.jail: none` — a sandboxed session cannot
reach the search service, and the runner indexes after this session exits:

```sh
llm-wiki-ops search index
```

Fail-open, and it indexes the markdown only. Never index the HTML.

## 8. Setup — the one interactive mode

`setup` as the argument, or §1 finding the `daily-report-setup` marker with
an operator at the keyboard. Follow
`references/setup.md`'s interview: inventory what is connected, ask what they
care about seeing each morning, cut sections nothing feeds, personalize the
template, fold the section plan and tone into the overlay on the operator's
yes, retire the marker when §1's read returned it — a redesign on a wiki
that already ran setup got no row and skips that step — and close under the
`grill` op, never `daily-report`, which would advance the window cursor.

## 9. Open questions — the grill loop

Plain bullets, optionally naming the profile page each would fill
(`- Is the Q3 pricing goal still alive? → goals`). Grill reads this section of
the newest report as top-priority gaps. When a question persists across
reports, print the instruction in the report and on the brief: **type
`/llm-wiki:grill`**.

## Never

- Write outside the report's markdown and HTML, the interactive-only first-run
  seeds, the promotion list, and the `wiki/log.md` and `wiki/index.md`
  entries.
- Read a raw channel capture, or touch another wiki in any writing way.
- Resolve contradictions, merge topic or concept pages, or downgrade stale
  facts — dream owns all three.
- Ask the user anything mid-run; §8 is the sole exception.
